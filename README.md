# ig-db-clone

## Description
A simplified clone of Instagram's database was created on MySQL with hypothetical data. The tables and the hypothetical data used were from [Colt Steele's MySQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/). Analyses on MySQL and Python were performed on my own.

## Analysis
I performed a series of queries/analyses to gather insights on photos, likes, and comments from the data using MySQL. I then extracted two tables to create visualizations on Python to determine whether there was a relationship between comments and likes on a photo, or tags and likes on a photo.
